# Managing Packages With npm

This is the boilerplate code for the Managing Packages With npm Challenges. Instructions for working on these challenges start at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/managing-packages-with-npm/


### Introduction to the Managing Packages with npm Challenges

The Node Package Manager (npm) is a command-line tool used by developers to share and control modules (or packages) of JavaScript code written for use with Node.js.

When starting a new project, npm generates a package.json file. This file lists the package dependencies for your project. Since npm packages are regularly updated, the package.json file allows you to set specific version numbers for each dependency. This ensures that updates to a package don't break your project.

npm saves packages in a folder named node_modules. These packages can be installed in two ways:

globally in a root node_modules folder, accessible by all projects.
locally within a project's own node_modules folder, accessible only to that project.
Most developers prefer to install packages local to each project to create a separation between the dependencies of different projects.

Working on these challenges involves writing code on Replit in our starter project.

Start by importing the project on Replit.
Next, you will see a .replit window.
Select Use run command and click the Done button.
Complete each challenge and copy the public Replit URL (to the homepage of your app) into the challenge screen to test it!
Optionally, you may write your project on another platform, but it must be publicly visible for our testing.

Start this project by cloning this repository on GitHub!
